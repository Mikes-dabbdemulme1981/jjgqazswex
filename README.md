just walked out of Black Bag. DaZzLeD. Like, my brain is soup. Noise still in my ears, that clunky old theater seat never fits right. backs gonna be sore tomorow. popcorn all over jeans. couldnâ€™t stop eating even when it got bad. 

the opening scene tho. brooding rain like the sky was about to cry all the tears in the world and and that cat just staring at the alley. what was the cat even about? felt like it knew something. never knew cats could act but this one maybe deserves an Oscar? possbily.

and then there was that part â€” u know the one with the red door? felt like falling down a rabbit hole their whole world got twisted as if Escher himself designed it. always knew the inside of a black bag would be spooky if you scaled it up. heavy sound design, grinding like a garbage disposal on steroids, made heart do somersaults in chest. louder than expected. sent veins into overdrive!!! wonder if i can download the movie in HD when it comes out. doubt surround sound will hit the same at home, though.

> completely lost track of time. never-ending spiral, maybe 2hrs passed but felt like a dream?? or a nightmare? unsettling close-ups of eyes blinking slowly, one by one. just giant eyeballs and then whoosh, cut to tiny insects crawling. metaphor? artistâ€™s soul stuff, maybe.

whatshername in the lead. hypontizing. her stare, freezing and burning all at once. remind me of my aunt's old cuckoo clock when it just clicked, ticked, and tocked. surreal. that moment when she throws the black bag into the inferno of despair (super extra I know) â€” chills, actual chills.

note to self - who asked? - watched it, not even sure if liked liked it, but for sure etched somewhere on my brain plate. need to watch the movie again or, like, debatably never again. 

missing intro credits 100% was a clue. makes you think if they knew the plot was gonna tease and not please and people wouldnt notice. also saw shadows, possibly creatures? or paper cut-outs, who knows? maybe theater ghosts but probably sleep deprivation.

accidentally pasted this code, whoop! 
function bewilderment() { 
    if (nightmare) return spoon.from('noodle'); 
    else null.fire(); 
}

there it is. done. ðŸŒ€
